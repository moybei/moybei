## Welcome to My Little Random Wonderland 🌟
Hi there! I am an enthusiastic explorer of new things of the world and currently working as an R&D Software Engineer. Here's a bit about me:

### 🌱 Always Learning, Continuous Exploration 🔍
I have a good understanding of 💻 **C++**, **Python**, and Git, along with some experience in terminal operations.<br />
My passion for continuous learning drives me to constantly expand my skill set. Lately, I've been diving into ⚛️React to stay ahead in the tech game.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy listening to music and watching anime girls to unwind and destress.
<br /><br />
My GitHub is a reflection of my curiosity and dedication to technology. Feel free to explore my projects.
<br />
Let's build something amazing together! 🚀
<br />
